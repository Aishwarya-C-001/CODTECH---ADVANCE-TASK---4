Task 4 - IMPLEMENT IAM POLICIES, SECURE STORAGE, AND DATA ENCRYPTION ON A CLOUD PLATFORM.

Objectives :

1.Access Control: Define granular permissions to restrict access based on roles.

2.Data Protection: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit to safeguard sensitive information.

3.Compliance Adherence: Meet industry standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS.

4.Auditing and Monitoring: Track and log activities to detect anomalies and maintain accountability.

Key points :

1.IAM Policies:

Implement least-privilege access principles.

Use role-based access control (RBAC).

Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).

2.Secure Storage:

Use AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage with encryption enabled.

Enable versioning and access logs.

Apply bucket policies and access control lists (ACLs).

3.Data Encryption:

Use AWS KMS or Azure Key Vault for key management.

Encrypt data at rest using AES-256.

Encrypt data in transit using TLS/SSL protocols.

4.Monitoring and Compliance:

Enable AWS CloudTrail and Azure Security Center for audits.

Configure automated alerts for security incidents.

Conclusion:

This multi-cloud architecture design demonstrates how to strategically distribute services across AWS and Azure to achieve high availability, scalability, and security. By integrating IAM policies, secure storage, and data encryption, organizations can further strengthen their data protection strategies. As cloud technologies evolve, multi-cloud approaches and security practices will continue to be vital for resilient and future-proof IT infrastructures.
